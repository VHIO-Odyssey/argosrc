\title{Seek Issues in REDCap Data Based on Verifications}
\usage{
argos_seek(rc_data, run_verifications = TRUE, return_no_issues_verif = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rc_data}{A data frame containing REDCap data with associated metadata.}

\item{run_verifications}{Logical, whether to execute the detected verifications on the data (default `TRUE`).}

\item{return_no_issues_verif}{Logical, if `TRUE`, return all verification results including those with no issues; otherwise, only return those with detected issues (default `FALSE`).}
}
\value{
A tibble of verifications applied to the data:
  - If `run_verifications = TRUE`, a tibble with verification function names, arguments, descriptions, issues found, and count of issues.
  - If `run_verifications = FALSE`, a tibble of detected verification rules that match the data.
}
\description{
This function processes REDCap data to detect applicable verification rules,
optionally runs these verifications on the data, and returns the results.
}
\details{
The function identifies applicable verifications based on the data's metadata,
matches verification arguments, and can run the verifications to detect data problems.
Verifications that do not apply or fail to match are excluded.
}
