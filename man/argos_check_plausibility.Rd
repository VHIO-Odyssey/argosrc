\title{Check Plausibility of REDCap Data}
\usage{
argos_check_plausibility(rc_data, constants_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rc_data}{A data frame representing the REDCap export data. It must
be obtained with \code{odytools::ody_rc_import} and contain a "metadata"
attribute describing the data dictionary.}

\item{constants_list}{Optional list of tibbles to provide additional constant values. Each tibble must include a `verif_fn` column indicating the verification function it applies to, along with other columns for arguments. Note that all arguments must be provided, regardless of whether they are constants or REDCap fields, in order to avoid potential ambiguity among candidate fields. These values will override any existing constants defined in the verification master.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
  \item{verif_fn}{The name of the verification function applied.}
  \item{verif_arg}{The valid candidate arguments used for verification.}
  \item{description}{Description of the verification.}
  \item{n_issues}{Number of issues detected by the verification.}
  \item{issues}{A list-column of data frames detailing detected issues.}
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates a REDCap dataset for plausibility issues by
applying a series of predefined verifications. It identifies valid
candidate fields based on metadata consistency, executes respective
verification functions, and returns detected issues.
}
\details{
The function uses global object `plausibility_verifications_master` to find
applicable verifications. It filters candidates by metadata consistency and
complexity ("intraform" constraints). Each verification function is called
with its respective arguments on `rc_data`, and the resulting issues are
collected.
