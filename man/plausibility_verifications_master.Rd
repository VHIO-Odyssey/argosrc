\title{Plausibility Verifications Master}
\format{
A data frame with variables:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Verification identification}
  \item{version}{Verification version. Different versions are used to handle the same verification with variables of different types.}
  \item{description}{Short verbal description of the purpose of the verification.}
  \item{comments}{Further explanations to fully understand how the verification works.}
  \item{complexity}{
    The complexity of the verification, determined by the origin of the variables (definitions in progress):
    \describe{
      \item{intraform}{All involved variables come from the same form.}
      \item{interform}{Variables come from different forms.}
      \item{interinstance}{The verification compares values of the same variable(s) from different instances.}
    }
  }
  \item{arguments_metadata}{
    A table with information about the arguments. It has one row per argument and the following columns:
    \describe{
      \item{argument}{The name of the argument.}
      \item{field_type}{The expected REDCap variable type.}
      \item{field_choices}{The expected REDCap variable choices.}
      \item{field_validation}{The expected REDCap variable validation type.}
    }
  }
  \item{candidates_mapping}{
    Possible names of the variables with which to run the verification. It is a table with as many columns as verification arguments and one row per each group of possible variable names.
  }
}
}
\usage{
plausibility_verifications_master
}
\description{
Dataset containing information on plausibility verifications. The function `argos_check_plausibility` uses this information to determine the applicable verifications for the current REDCap database.
